<h1 id="API-Security-for-Connected-Cars-and-Fleets"><a href="#API-Security-for-Connected-Cars-and-Fleets" class="headerlink" title="API Security for Connected Cars and Fleets"></a><strong>API Security for Connected Cars and Fleets</strong></h1><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>APIs enable effective connectivity between consumers and their vehicles, enterprise systems and applications, and enable automakers to expand the revenue streams and add new data driven features.</p>
<p>But this increased connectivity also opens the door to new threats. We’ll cover how these threats have evolved in recent years, and look into real world incidents where automotive and mobility services were impacted in an attack where APIs were exploited.</p>
<p>In the 2023 Global Automotive Cybersecurity Report, Upstream cybersecurity researchers and analysts investigated over 1,173 incidents, as early as 2010, and monitored hundreds of deep and dark web forums to compile this comprehensive, actionable report. But the most important thing is, we saw an increase of almost 400 percent in incidents since 2017. The exact number is 387%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most attacks are now being executed remotely with no need for physical tampering, which contributes to the scale of attacks and the number of impacted assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-does-this-mean-really"><a href="#What-does-this-mean-really" class="headerlink" title="What does this mean really?"></a>What does this mean really?</h2><p>Let’s take a car for example. In a connected vehicle, you don’t need to break the window to get inside anymore. All you need is to find vulnerability in an API, remotely unlock the car, and then drive away.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a simplistic explanation, but you get it. </p>
<p>Data can be leaked or tampered with for various reasons, from fraud to selling the database on the darknet. Premium paid for features can be unlocked by someone jailbreaking a car, for example. In a lot of these cases, we assume APIs are leveraged to carry out the attack.</p>
<p>As one of our examples later on shows. In 2022, Automotive and Smart Mobility API related incidents increased by 308%, accounting for 12 percent of total incidents. This is a very big jump. And when you consider that this is only based on reports made public and for attacks carried out, the numbers are probably a bit higher.</p>
<p>APIs have increasingly become a target for threat actors and even researchers looking for bounty. They are what enable the connected vehicles, but are also an increasingly growing attack surface.</p>
<p>So why APIs? At the core of it, it’s all about knowledge. Vehicles are so complex. You don’t need to know a ton about vehicles, ECUs, or how the engine works anymore. All you need is to understand how APIs work and start playing around.</p>
<p>Car hacking is no longer only about stealing a car or taming with it. It’s about impacting potentially millions of vehicles via an API.</p>
<p>Vehicle security has gone from being about protecting individual cars from super knowledgeable hackers to protecting millions of cars from tech savvy threat actors who know how to exploit the technology that connects vehicles to the world. And APIs are a growing threat landscape that the industry is striving to protect.</p>
<h1 id="Real-World-Examples"><a href="#Real-World-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Real-World Examples"></a><strong>Real-World Examples</strong></h1><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.57.18.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<h2 id="David-Colombo"><a href="#David-Colombo" class="headerlink" title="David Colombo"></a>David Colombo</h2><p>A 19 year old hacker and a security researcher, was able to control more than 25 Teslas around the world without their owner’s knowledge by exploiting a vulnerability in a third party app called Teslamate.</p>
<p>He was able to access 25 Teslas that used the app, and he did not have access to steering, braking, or acceleration, which could be especially dangerous. However, he was able to control some features of the cars, such as unlocking the doors, honking the horn, and flashing the lights. He was also able to see sensitive data, such as the car’s current location, the precise routes that the car took in the last few days, and the speed of the cars. He could also see the name that the owner gave to their Tesla.</p>
<p>He found a security vulnerability in the open source logging tool used by Teslamate and used it to gain access to the Tesla API keys. He then used the API keys to send commands to the Teslas. </p>
<p>This is a great example of why it’s crucial to consider not only securing internally APIs, but also to consider the impacts of third party APIs and what information is exposed to them. We see quite a few cases where third parties contribute to vulnerabilities, much like the next example.</p>
<h2 id="Sam-Curry"><a href="#Sam-Curry" class="headerlink" title="Sam Curry"></a>Sam Curry</h2><p>A security engineer, discovered a vulnerability in SiriusXM’s connected vehicle services that allowed him and his team to remotely start, unlock, locate, flash the lights and honk the horn on cars. He was able to identify a flaw in the authentication process that allowed him to gain unauthorized access to connected vehicle services.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was found in the telematics and infotainment systems powered by Sirius XM, which is used by 15 major car brands.</p>
<p>Curry found a loophole within the Sirius XM remote access software, which allowed users to authenticate to it using some form of mobile companion app. Users can log in to their accounts on these apps, which are linked to their vehicle’s VIN number, to execute commands and obtain information about their cars.</p>
<p>Curry alerted SiriusXM of the flaw, and the company quickly patched it within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Curry also found other vulnerabilities that allowed him to control vehicles remotely.</p>
<h2 id="Anonymous"><a href="#Anonymous" class="headerlink" title="Anonymous"></a>Anonymous</h2><p>The next incident had some really dramatic impact and is a great example of utilizing a business logic API attack.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, Elon Musk said that one of the biggest risks is that someone will achieve a fleet wide hack and send all vehicles to Rhode Island. And that’s kind of what happened here, but with a mobility service.</p>
<p>What happened is that using API calls to a mobility service, a well known hacktivist group managed to gridlock an entire city district, resulting in hours long traffic jams.</p>
<p>So, what exactly happened? On September 6th, 2022, hackers gained access to Yandex mobile app services. The hackers used Yandex Taxi, a ride hailing app, to order hundreds of drivers to the same location. This resulted in Moscow’s Philly district experiencing an unprecedented traffic jam.</p>
<p>The company later confirmed that it encountered an attempt to disrupt the service. and several dozen drivers received bulk orders.</p>
<p>The company reworked its routing algorithm following the attack to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. This is a really important part of API security, and it’s learning from attacks and ensuring that you patch vulnerabilities and mitigate future risks.</p>
<p>Anonymous, a group of hacktivists claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter, which is how we know it was them.</p>
<p>This is one of the first known instances of hackers exploiting a ride hailing app to create a traffic jam. It is also rumored that the hackers had reverse engineered parts of the Yandex software and figured out how to exploit their back end APIs to execute this attack.</p>
<h1 id="API-Attack-Surfaces"><a href="#API-Attack-Surfaces" class="headerlink" title="API Attack Surfaces"></a><strong>API Attack Surfaces</strong></h1><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.57.29.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Our starting point is the OWASP API Security Top 10. These guidelines provide a solid foundation for securing APIs across various industries.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t yet delved into the OWASP API Security Top 10, it’s a “live” list developed by the cybersecurity community to address the complexities of API security. These guidelines have been updated in 2023 to reflect the evolution of APIs and the ways in which they can be exploited by malicious actors.</p>
<p>The goal here is to heighten awareness of the most vulnerable aspects of APIs and ensure that developers, cybersecurity professionals, and QA teams are mindful of these vulnerabilities when developing and deploying code.<br>We recognize that even well-constructed APIs can be targeted by threat actors, with attacks becoming more sophisticated and impactful.</p>
<p>The OWASP API Security Top 10 serves as an excellent starting point for securing APIs. However, when considering fleets of connected cars, it’s helpful to think of APIs and their security in a more dynamic way. Just as a car is designed for entry through the driver-side door, users may find alternative ways to interact with it, such as through the passenger side, a window, or even the trunk.</p>
<h3 id="Case-1"><a href="#Case-1" class="headerlink" title="Case #1"></a>Case #1</h3><p>This analogy applies to APIs in the mobility ecosystem. For instance, an API designed to call a taxi to a specific location could be exploited if there’s no limit on the number of taxis that can be summoned to one place in a given time frame, leading to a business logic flaw.</p>
<h3 id="Case-2"><a href="#Case-2" class="headerlink" title="Case #2"></a>Case #2</h3><p>Another scenario could involve an API that returns excessive data, potentially allowing attackers to gather vehicle identification numbers (VINs) and access accounts. In OWASP terms, this is known as excessive data exposure.</p>
<p>Many of the real-world cybersecurity incidents we’ve analyzed involved the use of APIs in executing attacks.<br>Finally, there’s the risk of improper configuration, where someone might gain access to resources they shouldn’t have due to inadequate user validation. This represents one of the most significant threats: Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA).</p>
<h2 id="The-Operational-Perspective-for-API-Security"><a href="#The-Operational-Perspective-for-API-Security" class="headerlink" title="The Operational Perspective for API Security"></a>The Operational Perspective for API Security</h2><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.57.36.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>In the context of connected vehicles, with their extensive data and the APIs that transfer and affect vehicle operations, securing the ecosystem becomes a crucial question. How can this be achieved effectively?<br>The answer is context, because an API transaction on it’s own is just that. When we can understand the context we can identify if the behavior makes sense for the usecase.<br>For example, pairing requests between a user’s account and a vehicle identifying number. This is a legitimate API operation, which is allowed. But if a single user is trying to connect 50 VINs to a single account - all of those transactions together, they make less sense from a cybersecurity standpoint.<br>A single transaction may not seem big but when examined together with additional information in context we can understand the impact it might have on the entire fleet.<br>When it comes to automotive, mobility and transportation, we cannot simply analyze transactions on their own, but rather augment them with additional data to truly understand the impact of the transaction on product safety, drivers on the road and data privacy.<br>To do this we need to leverage additional data sources, this can be things like the IP of the user making the API call - maybe they are different to the account registered to the VIN previously? Or it can be a data point from the vehicle itself, like is the engine on.</p>
<h2 id="Connected-Software-Defined-Vehicles-Produce-Massive-Amounts-of-Data"><a href="#Connected-Software-Defined-Vehicles-Produce-Massive-Amounts-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="Connected &amp; Software Defined Vehicles Produce Massive Amounts of Data"></a>Connected &amp; Software Defined Vehicles Produce Massive Amounts of Data</h2><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.57.46.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Since connected vehicles are essentially computers on wheels and they generate massive amounts of data - from around 200 onboard sensors you can expect anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terra Bytes an hour to be produced.<br>All of this data cannot be utilized effectively in it’s raw form, it needs to be cleaned up and sorted into a “snapshot” of the vehicle so that when needed it can accurately reflect the state the vehicle was in and provide the context to understand what was going on.<br>This snapshot shouldn’t be limited to vehicles, it also encompasses API endpoints, and users. Logging all of the information in real-time to build a representation of each asset to be investigated when the time comes.</p>
<h2 id="Unique-Digital-Twin-Technology"><a href="#Unique-Digital-Twin-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Unique Digital Twin Technology"></a>Unique Digital Twin Technology</h2><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.57.52.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>A digital twin comprises data points collected at a specific moment, reflecting a snapshot of an asset, whether it’s an endpoint, consumer, or vehicle at a specific point in time. By analyzing these twins across fleets and over time, we can better discern trends and detect anomalies in the data.<br>Unique digital twins are created for endpoints, API consumers (users who access and initiate API calls), and vehicles, which are directly influenced by these APIs.<br>In the ecosystem of connected vehicles, fleets, mobility services, and EV charging, it’s crucial to understand that the impacts of APIs on these assets translate into real-world, physical consequences.</p>
<p>The automotive sector is particularly intriguing, with real vehicles powered by computer systems on the roads. It’s the context of these vehicles, in interaction with applications, that aids in identifying anomalies in the data.<br>For example, an API call to a hundred vehicles could be a routine operation for a fleet operator but potentially suspicious for an individual user. Context is key in these scenarios.<br>How do we interpret this context?<br>Each digital twin acts as a “snapshot” of an asset’s state at a particular time, based on the available data.<br>Creating a digital representation of the state of an asset - be it a vehicle, an API endpoint, or an API consumer - at a specific time allows us to understand the context of events and accurately detect anomalies. This correlation across digital twins affords a holistic view of activities across a fleet or multiple APIs.<br>This method facilitates near real-time detection of threats and attacks, enabling efficient mitigation and response by a virtual SOC or a company’s cybersecurity team.</p>

<p>To effectively identify threats, it’s essential to comprehend how these businesses operate. In the process of identifying threats, vulnerabilities, or ongoing attacks, it’s necessary to consider not just API traffic data but also operational data, and understand the impact of APIs to effectively detect anomalies.</p>
<p>By analyzing API traffic and correlating it with the contextual effects these transactions have on operational systems and assets, it becomes possible to uncover and monitor threats.<br>This is where the digital twin comes to life and why it’s so powerful.<br>In the automotive world, operational data is massive since there is a signal for every component in the vehicle. So the digital twin enables us to extract the most important value on the state of vehicles to effectively analyze the impact of transitions, in context.<br>This approach facilitates accurate detection and response to direct and third-party vulnerabilities, attacks, misconfigurations, and design flaws, which are inherent in APIs.<br>Key data sources in this context include vehicle telematics, vehicle sensors, API traffic, IT or OT events, among others.<br>Enabling application developers to rapidly deploy code is critical for quick time-to-market and the delivery of essential features and patches. These are vital for the functionality of numerous connected and smart mobility features.</p>
<p>Minimizing the cybersecurity impact on the deployment cycle requires near-real-time detection capabilities.<br>Previous real-world examples illustrate the severe impact of attacks that can gridlock a city or disrupt a fleet of delivery trucks. To mitigate such attacks, constant vigilance over APIs is required, irrespective of the pace of development.</p>
<h1 id="Next-Gen-API-Security-Detection"><a href="#Next-Gen-API-Security-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Next Gen API Security Detection"></a><strong>Next Gen API Security Detection</strong></h1><h2 id="Purpose-built-API-Security-Detection-for-Transportation"><a href="#Purpose-built-API-Security-Detection-for-Transportation" class="headerlink" title="Purpose-built API Security Detection for Transportation"></a>Purpose-built API Security Detection for Transportation</h2><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.58.12.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>APIs continually evolve alongside the threat landscape they present, a reality we’ve already established.<br>This evolution underscores the importance of equipping organizations with tools that are effective against both current and future threats to API security.<br>Addressing the challenge of “future-proofing” cybersecurity measures for APIs in the automotive, fleet, smart mobility, and transportation sectors starts with ensuring tool scalability. Given that API transactions now constitute a large fraction of internet traffic—a trend intensifying within the automotive ecosystem—it’s essential that these tools can scale up. The increase in API usage, along with the data generated by connected vehicles, IT, and OT assets, necessitates scalable monitoring and data ingestion capabilities.</p>
<p>The capability to handle the ingestion of extensive data volumes is critical for a long-term solution in API security. It’s also important to normalize data from operational and organizational systems in tandem with the growth in API transaction volumes. This approach is key to effectively detecting vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and threats.</p>
<p>Quick adaptation to evolving threats is crucial in a landscape where attacks are becoming more sophisticated. This adaptability enables the precise refinement of anomaly detection to meet unique business requirements and use cases, thereby enhancing mitigation and response efforts.</p>
<p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.58.22.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>The automotive industry is in the midst of a transformation, automakers and their partners are shifting from traditional car companies selling physical products into technology companies that deliver software features alongside their hardware.</p>
<p>Today, modern vehicles run more lines of code than an F35, reflecting the industry’s shift towards increasingly software-defined vehicles.</p>
<p>This shift sees the industry adopt an additional approach alongside the focus on lengthy product design cycles, which involve years of rigorous work for safety and production, to a more agile development process with faster delivery of new features enabled by software and APIs.</p>
<h2 id="End-to-End-API-Security"><a href="#End-to-End-API-Security" class="headerlink" title="End-to-End API Security"></a>End-to-End API Security</h2><p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.58.27.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>This accelerated development pace makes adopting a comprehensive shift-left approach critical for safeguarding products against cybersecurity attacks.<br>The shift-left approach integrates API security from the onset of software development, making it a core component of the process.<br>Prioritizing cybersecurity and testing measures early in the development process necessitates robust visibility.<br>Proactively detecting and resolving issues before deployment requires continuous discovery, monitoring, and detection of the organization’s APIs, regardless of whether they are internal, external, or used by third parties.<br>Given the potential of APIs in the automotive, smart mobility, and transportation industry to significantly impact assets, applying shift-left principles is crucial.<br>Developers must ensure that cybersecurity is a fundamental aspect of API design, rather than an afterthought.<br>This proactive strategy aids in identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in APIs before they escalate into critical issues.<br>This approach is ideal for those starting from scratch, without an existing API landscape already influencing numerous assets and consumers.</p>
<p><img src="/../Car_hacking_img/Screenshot%202024-05-28%20at%2012.58.38.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>In situations where an existing API landscape is in place, leveraging existing tools and processes within an organization, such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) systems, becomes essential.</p>
<p>SOAR systems streamline and enhance an organization’s cybersecurity operations by automating tasks, orchestrating workflows, and rapidly responding to cyber threats.</p>
<p>By utilizing existing processes and feeding in alerts informed by OT data, we can understand the context and impact of these alerts.</p>
<p>This enables not just stopping attacks but ensuring they don’t recur, addressing vulnerabilities in APIs as part of the shift-left approach.</p>
<p>So, how does this work in practice? Let’s say an alert was raised, and the account that triggered it can be immediately blocked in the SOC (or in the automotive world the vehicle SOC).</p>
<p>In an industry involving real drivers, they might contact the auto manufacturer’s support or their dealership to report issues like account malfunctions or other problems.<br>It’s crucial for the person answering the call to be able to query the caller effectively, understanding the full context of the situation.<br>They need to know the right questions to ask and how to address what may appear as a software bug or malfunction, which could, in fact, be the result of deliberate actions.<br>In addition to providing customer facing teams with the information they need to validate and understand the incident, these tools also allow for prompt handling of issues on the development side with alerts.</p>
<p>This is where OTA updates come in, since much like with mobile OS or applications, vehicles, too, get over-the-air updates on the regular. This means that for newer models, car owners don’t need to come in to a dealership to have software updates or patches installed to contain a vulnerability or address an issue.</p>
